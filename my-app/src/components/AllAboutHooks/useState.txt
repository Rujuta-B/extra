- the useState Hook lets you add state to the funcitnal cpmponent.

- In classes, the state is always an object.

- With the useState Hook the state doesn't always have to be an Objct. It can be an array, string, boolean or a number.

- the useState Hook returns an array with 2 elements.

- the first element is the current value of the state .

- the second element is the state setter function.

-If New state value depends on the previous state value? You can pass a function to the setter function.

When dealing with objects or arrays, always make sure to spread your state variable and then call the setter function.
